To implement a parent-child relationship for tags in your note-taking app, the system must support hierarchical tagging. Here's how we can modify your app to include parent tags:
Steps to Add Parent Tags

    Database Changes:
        Add a parent-child relationship in the Tags table.
        Introduce a parent_id column to the Tags table, allowing each tag to reference another as its parent.

    Update GUI:
        Provide a way to assign a parent tag to a new tag.
        Display the tag hierarchy visually, such as in a tree structure.

    CRUD Operations:
        Adjust tag creation, updating, and deletion logic to consider the parent-child relationship.

    Display:
        Update the tags panel to show tags hierarchically.

    Backend Updates:
        Write helper methods to fetch tags with their hierarchies.
Notes & Tags Manager

Notes & Tags Manager is a desktop application built with Python and wxPython for managing notes and hierarchical tags. It allows you to create, edit, and delete notes, as well as organize them using a nested tag structure. The app features a user-friendly interface with a tabbed layout for easy navigation.
Features

    Notes Management:

        Create, edit, and delete notes.

        View notes with their creation and modification timestamps.

    Hierarchical Tags:

        Create tags and nested child tags.

        Assign tags to notes for better organization.

        View a hierarchical tree of all tags in a dedicated tab.

    User Interface:

        Tabbed interface for managing notes and tags.

        Interactive tree view for tags.

        Buttons for adding child tags to existing tags.

Requirements

    Python 3.x

    wxPython (pip install wxPython)

    SQLite3 (included with Python)


Usage
Notes Tab

    Add Note: Click the "Add Note" button to create a new note. Enter a title and content, then save.

    Edit Note: Select a note from the list and click "Edit Note" to modify its title or content.

    Delete Note: Select a note and click "Delete Note" to remove it.

Tags Tab

    Add Tag: Click the "Add Tag" button to create a new tag. You can optionally assign a parent tag.

    Add Child Tag: In the "Tags Tree" tab, select a tag and click "Add Child Tag" to create a nested tag under the selected one.

    View Tags: The "Tags Tree" tab displays all tags in a hierarchical structure.

Database Schema

The application uses an SQLite database (notes.db) with the following tables:

    Notes:

        id: Unique identifier for each note.

        title: Title of the note.

        content: Content of the note.

        created_at: Timestamp when the note was created.

        updated_at: Timestamp when the note was last updated.

    Tags:

        id: Unique identifier for each tag.

        name: Name of the tag.

        parent_id: ID of the parent tag (for nested tags).

    NoteTags:

        note_id: ID of the note.

        tag_id: ID of the tag assigned to the note.
