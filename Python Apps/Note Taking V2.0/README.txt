To implement a parent-child relationship for tags in your note-taking app, the system must support hierarchical tagging. Here's how we can modify your app to include parent tags:
Steps to Add Parent Tags

    Database Changes:
        Add a parent-child relationship in the Tags table.
        Introduce a parent_id column to the Tags table, allowing each tag to reference another as its parent.

    Update GUI:
        Provide a way to assign a parent tag to a new tag.
        Display the tag hierarchy visually, such as in a tree structure.

    CRUD Operations:
        Adjust tag creation, updating, and deletion logic to consider the parent-child relationship.

    Display:
        Update the tags panel to show tags hierarchically.

    Backend Updates:
        Write helper methods to fetch tags with their hierarchies.
